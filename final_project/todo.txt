To do for next week:
    - DONE: Change svg region id to class
    - Change rank to sort and rank data based on filtered data
        - Filtering by year shouldn't leave gaps
    - Add functionality of publisher, console, and genre filters
        -500+ publishers, populate whole dropdown or just select top x?
        - Want to dynamically add console key to console dropdown (ditto for Genre)
    - Add dynamic y scaling
    - Get boxes to remember previous location when performing animation transition.

    - MINOR: Make BG less obviously tiled
    - MINOR: Begin to implement themes.
    - TERTIARY: Width/height/positioning in CSS and pass to js for graph scaling?
