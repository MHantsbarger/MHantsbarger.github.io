To do for next week:
1. Get stacked color coded bars for top 50 games, by region sold.
    stacked bars (https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#stacks)
    DONE: data stacked into four stacked bars for each region (NA,EU,JPN,Other)
2. Convert sales numbers into a human readable format.
    d3-format (https://github.com/d3/d3-format)
    DONE: used d3.format to convert into millions
        (kinda cheats using scientific notation: Mega abbrevation coincides with millions abrv)
3. Adjust height and width of elements to be scalable.
    COMPLETED: initial adjustment of frame and sidebar height and width based on user's screen.
    IN PROGRESS: need to update graph position and scaling.
4. Reach Goal: Start adding filters buttons and hookup.
