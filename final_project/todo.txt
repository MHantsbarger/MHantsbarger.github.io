To do for next week:
    - DONE: Add year filter and implement functionality
    - DONE: Add region filter and implement functionality
    - Change x axis to be first X amount of array.
    - Add rest of filters (as much functionality as possible)
    - Add my name

    - MINOR: Make BG less obviously tiled
    - MINOR: Begin to implement themes.
    - TERTIARY: Width/height/positioning in CSS and pass to js for graph scaling?

Issues:
    - how to clear barGrBars?
    - Rank might be confused with "rank of other filtered games"
    - Around 275 games with N/A as year published.



3/28 goals:
1. DONE: Add tooltips for all bars in the graph.
2. IN PROGRESS: Add filter buttons and begin hooking up year.
3. DONE (always more to do): Fonts and backgrounds.

3/21 goals:
1. Get stacked color coded bars for top 50 games, by region sold.
    stacked bars (https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#stacks)
    DONE: data stacked into four stacked bars for each region (NA,EU,JPN,Other)
2. Convert sales numbers into a human readable format.
    d3-format (https://github.com/d3/d3-format)
    DONE: used d3.format to convert into millions
        (kinda cheats using scientific notation: Mega abbrevation coincides with millions abrv)
3. Adjust height and width of elements to be scalable.
    COMPLETED: initial adjustment of frame and sidebar height and width based on user's screen.
    IN PROGRESS: need to update graph position and scaling.
4. Reach Goal: Start adding filters buttons and hookup.
